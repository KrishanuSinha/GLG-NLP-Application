## Problem Statement:
Our company receives hundreds of requests a day from clients seeking insights on topics ranging from the
airline industryâ€™s ability to cope with COVID-19 to the zebra mussel infestations in North America. The goal is to match each request to a topic specialist in our database.

## Solution:
My solution to this problem would break down each request into topics ranging from Science, Health, Education, etc.
and additionally performing NER on the text. While researching the problem statement, I found that in many cases,
inter-topic distance is very less i.e., topics tend to overlap and in those cases, it is difficult to decide the nature
of the request in case of large text. In my project, I have dealt with this issue by applying a text summarization model
and thereby making the text more readable. My approach has been to use all NLP solutions to break down complicated-looking texts into simple forms.
